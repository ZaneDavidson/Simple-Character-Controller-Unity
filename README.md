# Simple-Character-Controller-Unity
Unity character controller using rigidbody movement

Creates a controller using raw x,y axis data from the mouse
ideally used to control a 3rd person character as the camera is bound to a point in world space controlled by the mouse, not mouse movement
uses force applied through the rigidbody component, not character controller
